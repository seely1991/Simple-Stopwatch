# Simple-Stopwatch

This was one of my first attempts to try and create a simple one page javascript app.

I started using a `setInterval()`, but then made a way for the timer to continue even when the page's tab wasn't open using date objects including `new Date.now()`.

The inception of the idea was to create an online stopwatch that my wife could use for her job (she is an online stylist for stitch fix and uses an online timer to keep track of her personal performance), so a lot of the color themes were based on my wife's personal preferences.
